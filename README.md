# Shifter
Simple and easy to use daily shiftboard for assigning shifts in timeslots to users. All-in-one file (shifter.html) containing HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I created this basic version for my work, so we can assign shifts to people on a daily basis using a touch TV (Samsung Flip). This works out very well. 

Try right away by opening the file from GitHUB: https://raw.githack.com/deneijk/Shifter/main/shifter.html

You can download and run in browser locally, edit the file to change users and shifts. If you would like to contribute to the project and make this a more feature complete free shiftboard solution for yourself and others, be my guest and let me know. 

Thanks for using, I certainly hope it supports your daily shiftplanning,

Dennis
